//! Execute tasks on the current thread
//!
//! [`CurrentThread`] provides an executor that keeps futures on the same thread
//! that they are submitted on. This allows it to execute futures that are
//! `!Send`. For more details on general executor concepts, like executing
//! futures, see [here].
//!
//! Before being able to execute futures onto [`CurrentThread`], an executor
//! context must be setup. This is done by calling [`run`].  From within that
//! context, [`CurrentThread::execute`] may be called with the future to run in
//! the background.
//!
//! ```
//! # use futures::executor::current_thread::*;
//! use futures::future::lazy;
//!
//! // Calling execute here results in a panic
//! // CurrentThread::execute(my_future);
//!
//! CurrentThread::run(|_| {
//!     // The execution context is setup, futures may be executed.
//!     CurrentThread::execute(lazy(|| {
//!         println!("called from the current thread executor");
//!         Ok(())
//!     }));
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! # Execution model
//!
//! When a [`CurrentThread`] execution context is setup with `run`,
//! the current thread will block and all the futures managed by the executor
//! are driven to completion. Whenever a future receives a notification, it is
//! pushed to the end of a scheduled list. The [`CurrentThread`] executor will
//! drain this list, advancing the state of each future.
//!
//! All futures managed by [`CurrentThread`] will remain on the current thread,
//! as such, [`CurrentThread`] is able to safely execute futures that are `!Send`.
//!
//! Once a future is complete, it is dropped. Once all [non
//! daemon](#daemon-futures) futures are completed, [`CurrentThread`] unblocks.
//!
//! [`CurrentThread`] makes a best effort to fairly schedule futures that it
//! manages.
//!
//! # Daemon Futures
//!
//! A daemon future is a future that does not require to be complete in order
//! for [`CurrentThread`] to complete running. These are useful for background
//! "maintenance" tasks that are not critical to the completion of the primary
//! computation.
//!
//! When [`CurrentThread`] completes running and unblocks, any daemon futures
//! that have not yet completed are immediately dropped.
//!
//! A daemon future can be executed with [`CurrentThread::execute_daemon`].
